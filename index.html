    <h2>THE BAND</h2>
    <p>Tiger Bonesaw is a rock band hailing from Germany. Their sound is melodic, yet energetic
       and hard-hitting, often inspired by artists as diverse as Foo Fighters, Biffy Clyro,
        Queens Of The Stone Age, and more. </p>

    <p>The group also holds distinctive stoner rock influences, adding depth and atmospherics
       to their sound due to the diverse background of the band’s line-up. The group features 
       guitarist Carsten Przyluczky, as well as bassist Stefan Marien, lead vocalist / guitarist 
       Dennis Hadrika, and last but not least, Jorg Skaramaga behind the drum kit. </p>
      
    <p>Recently, Tiger Bonesaw set out to release their debut album, which is also accompanied
       by a music video for leading single “The Mean Scene.” </p>
